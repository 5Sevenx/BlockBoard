<h2 align="center">BlockBoard</h2>

<p>BlockBoard is an application that gives you a random number and a random letter on your keyboard
After that, the keyboard and mouse are disabled(only 2 keys are not disabled â€” your combination)
So you need to press the combination of the letter and the number to end the loop and end the execution.
